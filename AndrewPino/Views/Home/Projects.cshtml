      <h5 class="card-title">Mass Image Processing Tool</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Conceptualized, created requirements, including mockups, and followed through with the completion of the project. This program allows users to import mass numbers of images while still allowing to view and make edits as needed. This increased the Google rank of products on our website and contributed tremendously to the company growing from 2M per year to over 2M per month.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Advanced Product Filter</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Conceptualized, created requirements, including mockups, and followed through with the completion of the project. This program allows users to provide basic input and outputs that generate SQL based reports. This dramatically decreased the number of reporting requests for IT, e.g., creating SSRS reports. This also dramatically increased the throughput of the data management team, allowing them to easily clean data and keep it up-to-date. The database holds over 450,000 complex products that are managed by a very small team. This feature also contributed to a higher Google ranking and an over-all better web presence for products.</p>
